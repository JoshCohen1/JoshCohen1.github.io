Data Analytics Portfolio:
This portfolio contains my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate that I recently completed.  I've included the R code used to construct my analysis, an RMarkdown file explaining the rationale for the steps that were taken, and a powerpoint presentation detailing my findings.  The project focuses on an analysis constructed for a fictional bike sharing company that operates in Chicago.
